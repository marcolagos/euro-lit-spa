    <h2>Classical Literature</h2>
    <p>
      The definition of classical literature varies quite a bit depending on the person asked. For me, I define classical literature to be the literature of Ancient Greece and the Golden and Silver Ages of Rome, although there are also classical literary traditions in many other ancient civilizations. I am sure there are many websites devoted to discussing this ancient literature; this is another such example. Although this website is far from extensive, here I offer my unauthoritative and non-extensive thoughts on some famous pieces of writing, not necessarily classical. In addition to discussing some of the literature of ancient times, I also include depictions of the ancient pieces with a comment devoted to them as well. I hope you enjoy!

          <h1 class="h1-specific">Conversion of St.Augustine</h1>
          <p class="p-specific">
            Fra Angelico's "Conversion of Saint Augustine" painting is a beautiful and powerful depiction of the moment when Saint Augustine was converted to Christianity. The painting captures the intensity of the moment with its vibrant colors and dynamic composition. The figures in the painting are arranged in a way that conveys a sense of movement and energy, while also highlighting the importance of Augustine's conversion. The use of light and shadow further emphasizes the spiritual nature of the scene, as well as Augustine's newfound faith. Overall, Fra Angelico's "Conversion of Saint Augustine" is an inspiring work that conveys the power and beauty of faith.

        <h1 class="h1-specific">Second circle of Hell</h1>
        <p class="p-specific">Ary Scheffer's Francesca da Rimini, beautiful painting that captures all sorts of emotions. There are two sides to this story. The justice of God's law is evident in the meeting between Dante and Virgil and Paolo and Francesca. By being condemned to an eternity of suffering in the second circle of Hell, Paolo and Francesca are being punished for their sin of adultery. This punishment serves as a reminder to all that God's law must be respected and followed, lest one suffer the same fate. It is a reminder that no matter how powerful or influential one may be, they are still subject to God's law and will be held accountable for their actions. In this way, the justice of God's law is made clear. However, the sadness that Dante and Virgil feel upon meeting Paolo and Francesca is understandable. The two lovers were tragically separated by death, and their story of forbidden love is heartbreaking. It is a reminder of the fragility of life and the power of love, even in the face of death. The sadness that Dante and Virgil feel is a reflection of their own understanding of the tragedy that befell Paolo and Francesca, as well as a recognition of the beauty in their story.

          <h1 class="h1-specific">Aeneas in the Underworld</h1>
          <p class="p-specific">One of the most heart-wrenching scenes in the Aeneid is when Aeneas visits the underworld and meets his father Anchises. Anchises shows Aeneas a vision of the future, revealing that Rome will be a great empire and that his descendants will be powerful rulers. This scene is so emotional because it is a moment of hope for Aeneas, who has been struggling to find his place in the world and to fulfill his destiny. He finally sees a glimpse of what his future holds, and it gives him strength to continue on his journey. This meeting is significant because it serves as a reminder of Aeneas' destiny and provides him with the motivation he needs to fulfill his mission. It also serves as a reminder of the importance of family and ancestry, as Anchises reveals to Aeneas that he will be part of an illustrious line of descendants that will include Julius Caesar and Augustus. (Painting on the left is of the 1630s inspired by the "hell landscapes" of Jan Brueghel the Elder which in turn looked back to Bosch. The subject is from Virgil, Aeneid, Book VI.)

Whichever man could shoot an arrow through twelve axe-heads would be the winner, and gain her hand in marriage. Odysseus was the only one who could complete the challenge, and having shot the arrow, he threw off his disguise, and together with Telemachus slaughtered the suitors.

    <h1>What is Xenia in the Odyssey?
      </h1>
   <p>
    Xenia in the Odyssey is about showing hospitality to strangers or guests and treating them well. Throughout the Odyssey, there are many examples of good and bad xenia, both of which tell the readers a lot about the practicing characters. In addition, the characters in the epic poem generally exhibit a pattern of xenia, almost as if marking off a checklist in order to fall under the category of a good host. In the Homeric society, xenia also plays a vital role in character relationships and is extremely important as it tells the level of civilization of groups of people, especially relative to Odyesseus. Lastly, xenia is quite prominent when Odyesseus encounters new peoples. It is worth noting that during his arrival back home in Ithaca, xenia pushes the drama forward and, in some way, helps Odysseus achieve his long-awaited return to kingship.
   </p>
   <p>
    Throughout the epic poem, smaller instances of xenia appear consistently, and although they are more peripheral compared to others, the instances still reinforce the powerful expectation of xenia in the poem. Telemachus’s xenia and experiences with xenia arguably fall into this category. In Book I, early in the poem, the readers witness one of the first demonstrations of xenia when Telemachus notices a disguised Athena and invites her in, washing her hands, feeding her, and playing music. He says to her “‘Good evening, stranger, and welcome. Be our guest, come share our dinner, and then tell us what you need.”’ Even early on in the story, a precedent is set: welcome a guest into the home, offer a comfortable resting place and food and drink, and send the guest off with a gift and transportation. Only after following this type of procedure does Telemachus finally ask Athena about herself. These are the general guidelines that qualify as good xenia in the ancient homeric world. In the same Book I, we also see Telemachus describe to Athena a contrast to the good xenia he just exhibited. Telemachus says about the suitors: “‘[The suitors are] wasting our whole house…They keep eating, 250 spoiling my house…”’ And Athena’s reaction highlights the importance as well of a proper guest in tandem with a hospitable host, describing the suitors’ actions as monstrous and dubbing them “shameless”. Thus, in addition to displaying good xenia, there exists also an expectation for the guest to also honor the hosts. 
   </p>
   <p>
    Another warm instance of xenia involves Telemachus traveling to Plyos, King Nestor, to inquire about his father. As soon as Nestor and his sons catch sight of “strangers coming”, they immediately stood up “with open arms to greet them, inviting them to join them” in eating and drinking. To the modern reader, this is a heart-warming scene of almost innocent trust. Today, to receive strangers with such openness and liberty into one’s home would be labeled as immensely naive; however, in this homeric setting, such xenia is commonplace. Note that again in this scene, King Nestor adheres to the formula of xenia, satisfying and comforting his guests before seeking answer to their purpose. Note that once Nestor advises Telemachus to visit Menelaus for more information, he offers to provide the means of transportation. The following day he prepares a feast, gifts, and even has his eldest daughter wash and clothe Telemachus. He provides Telemachus with horses to ride to Menelaus’s house in Sparta, additionally sending one of his sons.
   </p>
   <p>
    As Telemachus arrives in Sparta to Menelaus’s home, they find Menelaus in the middle of celebrating one of his children’s weddings. A comical scene ensures for the modern reader. Menelaus’s guard, Eteoneus, spots Telemachus and Nestor’s son, running to Menelaus, he says “‘...should we take off the harness from their horses? Or send them off to find another host?”’ Menelaus responds angrily shouting ‘“You used to have some brains! Now you are talking like a silly child…Lead them in to dine!”’ Even hesitating to bring in a couple of unknown men angered Menelaus. This scene really speaks to the emphasis placed on xenia for the Greeks. Menelaus offers Telemachus food and drink, speaking to him about Odysseus among other topics, ending by sending Telemachus away with gifts.
   </p>
   <p>
    Already with Telemachus, the readers experience three strong examples of good xenia. Exploring more into the world of xenia in the Odyssey, Odysseus washes up on the shore of the Phaeacians, where he surprises Nausicaa, daughter of King Alcinous. At this point in time, Odysseus is completely naked, looking ragged and beat up. With the help of Athena, Nausicaa shows him the town, gives me food and drink, bathes him, and clothes him. Again, particularly in this situation where showing generosity toward a guest does not seem like the natural option by any means, Nausicaa and the Phaeacians still offer their best services to Odysseus. Later on in Book 9, Odysseus tells King Alcinous of his travels. He tells the tale of his encounter with the Cyclopes; a story that highlights the stark contrast between a civilized xenia-practicing people and a boorish uncivilized group. Odysseus and some of his men have wandered into the cave of Cyclops Polyphemus. Odysseus’s men urge him to take some of the cave’s stored supplies; however, Odysseus refuses since he would like to “‘find out if he would give us gifts.”’ The reader is able to see how xenia is driving the plot forward in a way, as Odysseus confies in this expectation for hosts to show him good xenia. 
   </p>
   <p>
    When Polyphemus gets back to his cave, he finds Odysseus there and says “‘Strangers! Who are you? Where did you come from…”’ This is completely against the proper procedure for good xenia. A good host, in these homeric times, asks about the guests only after they have eaten and settled down. In addition, instead of offering food, drink, and comfort, Polyphemus kills and feasts on some of Odysseus’s men. Cyclops has no inclination to be a proper host, as he does not respect the expected guidelines for a host. He says ‘“My people think nothing of that Zeus with his big scepter.”’ What stands out about this situation is the fact that in many aspects and details, the Cyclops are shown to be primitive dwelling in caves and herding sheep, as well as dim-witted while showing no respect for the gods. On the other hand, for Menelaus’s household, it is described as being elegant, the “lofty halls of famous Menelaus shone like the dazzling light of sun or moon.” Thus, the contrast between civilized and primitive, honorable and stupid, xenia and a lack thereof is clear cut in the Odyssey. 
   </p>
   <p>
    Xenia plays another important role in the Odyssey, that is, it led to the conclusion of Odysseus's 20 or so years away from home. When Odyesseus arrives at the bay of Ithaca, he travels along the road, coming to a swineherd. He is suddenly attacked by aggressive dogs, when the swineherd Eumaeus saves him and, afterward, brings him over to eat and drink his fill. They both exchange stories, and Eumaeus prepares Odysseus’s bed in a warming scene: “Eumaeus tucked him in a big thick cloak.” Once Odysseus travels to his home, Penelope also shows good xenia, washing, clothing, and feeding him, as well as offering some sort of protection from the suitors (Telemachus too). Penelope’s hospitality plays an even more important role in the poem, when the box competition comes into light. The suitors do not want Odysseus the beggar to have access to the bow; however, Penelope calls them out on it, saying “‘it is not right to disrespect a guest Telemachus has welcomed to this house.”’ This allows for Odyssesus to exact his revenge on the suitors, winning the competition and absolutely massacring all the suitors. In other words, the hospitality displayed by Penelope allows for Odysseus to grow into his epic hero role, taking control of his kingdom once more. 
   </p>
   <p>
    Good xenia continually drives the narrative in the Odyssey, as it plays significant roles in Telemachus’s development and Odyesseuss's success in getting home. It also drives the plot in that it allows for characters like Odyesseus to grow into their heroic element having reached home. And lastly, the contrast between good xenia and bad xenia helps the reader characterize characters in the poem.

  <div class="comment">The Greek philosopher Socrates was convicted of impiety by the Athenian courts; rather than renounce his beliefs, he died willingly, discoursing on the immortality of the soul before drinking poisonous hemlock.

    <h1>Does Socrates make an effective speech of self-defense in the Apology? Would 
      you acquit him or find him guilty? Why?
      </h1>
    <p>
      As a quick review, Socrates has been accused of impiety and corrupting Athenian youth by Melitus. Socrates has supposedly refused to recognize the Athenian gods and has been corrupting the youth with this “thinkery”. He is brought to make his defense in the court, which is recorded in Plato’s Apology.
    </p>
    <p>
      Does Socrates make an effective speech of self-defense in the Apology? I would first like to delve into the importance of winning over a jury as a defendant, which is a group of Athenians, in this case. In front of a jury, one of a defendant's goals is to connect with the jury and gain their trust, while making one’s case a just one. Some typical strategies of defendants would be to display respect for the judicial process, conduct a gentle cross-examination, and to touch on relevant topics concerning the case. All this to say, Socrates’s own defense hardly connects him to the jury (much less adhering to any of these strategies); instead, he does quite the opposite, driving them away and rejecting any form of pity they could potentially have towards him. From a court of law’s perspective, as a jury, I would not be inclined to free Socrates from his charges, based solely on his refusing to accept in the slightest any truth that the charges brought against him could hold. However, due to his arguments, explicated through his eloquence, personally, I would acquit him of his charges, supporting him in his endeavors. 
    </p>
    <p>
      Throughout Socrates’s defense, I would like to make some interesting notes. First, Socrates seems to approach his whole defense in a truthful, genuine manner, where he will always say what he thinks staunchly, without deviating from his way of thinking. While this may come to the jurors as a form of defiance and brutality in thought, it strikes me as intriguing and a necessity for society, to develop this independent thought, as Socrates might say. As a juror though, this type of speech could come off as pompous and stubborn. Second, Socrates’s defense is adequate to acquit him from his charges, as pushes Melitus to contradict himself about Socrates being an atheist or introducing new deities. In addition, Socrates also explains that Melitus’s thoughts on the subject of corrupting or improving youth is shallow; he does this through a detailed and skilled line of questioning.
    </p>
    <p>
      Let us first discuss the beginning of this argument where In making his defense, Socrates argues against two accusations, one old and one new. He actually seems to place more weight on the older one, since there are so many that accuse him. He summarizes the accusation for the court briefly saying “‘Socrates is an evil-doer, and a curious person, who searches into things under the earth and in heaven, and he makes the worse appear the better cause; and he teaches the aforesaid doctrines to others.'” Socrates explains the relevance of this story to this case, as it has some of the same accusations that are brought to him in the present day. In addition, he mentions Aristophanes parody of him, which although was meant to be comical and a joke of a portrayal of Socrates, people will inevitably have this preconceived notion of this in their mind. Socrates is very clever here, as he begins to break down the jurors' potential biases towards him from the very beginning, debunking their possible source of acquaintance with Socrates. Socrates then states how this bad opinion of him came about, a story of the oracle at Delphi, which told one of his acquaintances that he was wisest of all men. Socrates then proceeded to go to the other wise men that he knew of and expose them as phonies basically, telling them that their wisdom was merely a shell. He on the other hand knew that his wisdom and knowledge was little and insecure; therefore, because he was aware of his ignorance of the world, he knows what he does not know, he is not the wisest. This, of course, did not rub well with the politicians, poets, leaders that he interrogated, making enemies for himself. He also states that he made enemies as a result of the jealously experienced by many, because of their own incompetence, the unwise became angry not at themselves, but at him. Again, he gained enemies. As a consequence of these events, Socrates states that this is why Melitus and his friends are bringing charges up against him. This is an intelligent maneuver by Socrates, as he puts plainly the motivations of his accusers, which amounts to a form of sensible but opinionated ill-will and immature jealousy. 
    </p>
    <p>
      Socrates proceeds further to now break down Melitus’s arguments explicitly in front of the court and contend the new accusations pit against him. Meletus accused Socrates of being  evil, corrupting the youth while not acknowledging the gods of the state, and introducing new gods of his own. Socrates calls Melitus to the stand. In a skilful line of questioning, Melitus ends up tripping over himself, contradicting that Scorates is an atheist, while bringing new gods to the table. In addition, Socrates asks who else is corrupting the youth of Athens, and to Meltius it is no one but Socrates. This is definitely implausible, as Socrates makes clear in his line of questioning. His make Melitus look like just a hater who does not like Socrates, since he does not concede that there may be others who are not good influences on the youth. Socrates then makes a weaker argument, that he would not want to be corrupting the youth that he lives with, as it wouldn’t be a sensible thing to do.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the vote comes about in majority against him, Socrates states that he is surprised that there were not more that were against him. In Athens, the accused and convicted are given an opportunity to suggest an alternative sentence, as Socrates is going off to death. The alternatives would include paying money or being exiled for some time. However, Socrates does not back down or concede or fear for his life. His conviction shines out. He states that he has no money to pay the fine, even though he could get some of his wealthy supporters to pay for him, and that he would not leave the place where his duty was, Athens, just to escape death. In addition, in doing any of these things, he explains, he would be admitting guilt, that he had done something wrong, even though he believed that none of his actions deserved any type of punishment. Finally, as he is re-convicted and sentenced to die by poison, he gives one last defiant word, telling them that they may think they did themselves good by getting rid of him, the evil one, but in fact, they did themselves more harm than they will do to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Overall, even though Socrates makes a skillful argument to his innocence, he does not appeal to the jurors with humility or pity. Instead, he keeps a defiant attitude toward the entire process, at least that is the way it looks to the jurors, by continuing to stick by his life goals. His goals are to educate the youth and the old in the way of independent thinking. Personally, because of his skillful argument, I would free him of his charges, judging not guilty, but from a jurors point of view, I would judge him harshly due to his lack of humility in defense.

    <h1>What is Augustine’s attitude toward classical literature, including the Aeneid? What tensions and ambiguities are visible?
      </h1>
      <p>
        Augustine’s account in his Confessions offers a riveting portrayal of a man completely torn between two sides. In fact, I would go as far to say that his autobiography is a thematically focused on dichotomies: the worldly and the spiritual, lust and chastity, the secular and the Christian. This separation extends to classical literature, as Augustine contemplates the purpose, usefulness, and importance of classical literature. While Augustine greatly admired classical literature, particularly the works of Virgil, Homer, and Cicero, believing that these stories could teach us important lessons about courage, justice, and virtue, he also certainly points out that classical literature is also distinct and separate from Christianity.
      </p>
      <p>
        In his Confessions, Augustine is in a tug-of-war battle, and he is the rope. This is the reason that the account resonates and punctures the minds of its readers. Is there anyone who has lived a life without their own tug-of-war battle? It could be laziness and diligence, impurity and purity, faithlessness and loyalty, happiness and sadness, disbelief and devotion, or even something as simple as procrastinating an essay and getting started on your work. In jus t about everyone’s lives, there is some tension, some pull, in different directions. It could even be by your own friends and family, balancing work and leisure. This tension is palpable in Augustine’s life. In addition, he adds classical literature in the mix. 
      </p>
      <p>
        The first mention of any classical literature is in Book I, where Augustine points out the lack of utility that “[memorizing] the wanderings of some fellow called Aeneas” served. He juxtaposes this with the great usefulness of his early lessons in literacy. Augustine uses his thoughts and emotional reactions to Virgil’s Aeneid when he was younger to express his dismay over his immaturity and distractions of his youth. He laments, “I could weep over the death of Dido” because of love yet “I shed no tears over the death I brought upon myself for not loving you”. And also that as he focused on Aeneas wanderings, he forgot his own wanderings, pulled in different directions by his youth.
      </p>
      <p>
        It is also clear from his thoughts about his youthful past, that he believes he did not use his abilities wisely, with classical literature and education acting almost as an inhibitor to his coming to Christ. As a youth, he zealously desired recognition and prestige through his education, while looking back he states that he “squandered the brains [God gave him] on foolish delusions.” From his perspective, it seems that Augustine would agree that his learnings were futile, as he did not understand at all what aspects of the literature applied to his life. Wanderings of Aeneas, yet he made no connection to his own. Death of Dido, yet he did not bridge the relation with his own spiritual death from God. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Augustine reiterates this idea in Book IV: in summary, “what profit was it to me that I…rascally slave of selfish ambitions that I was read and understood as many books as I could get [about] liberal arts”. And now, the punching statement: “I enjoyed these not recognizing the source of whatever elements of truth and certainty they contained.” In other words, he studied and read these classical literature and advanced his education apart from God. The only way, as the older Augustine sees it, to fruitfully experience knowledge in the secular world, with its truths and revelations, is through the lens of a spiritual Christian perspective and understanding. Augustine establishes tension between Godly and worldly, sharing common ground only through an understanding of the Godly. His account of his juggling of literature and education, as religious beliefs call him to be different, indirectly, yet powerfully, pushes the reader to introspection, to question his own motivations and purposes in all his endeavors, even something as the great tales of classical literature. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Augustine is enthralled by Virgil’s Aeneid in his youth and early on he sets out for reputation through his education. Looking back, Augustine reflects on the value of the literature without his spiritual convictions.
